------------User Manual: ND Coin------------
This program is fairly straightforward to run: to compile, simply run the make command at the terminal command line.  
From here, you will want to have a dedicated window for the server.  For testing purposes, change the set_up_test() function:

void set_up_test(){
	for(int i=0;i<100;i++)
		the_bank.giveCoin("bjudson1",i);

	for(int j=101;j<200;j++)
		the_bank.giveCoin("dchao",j);
}

in the server.cpp file to have a beginning user and balance size for as many test users as you wish.  
Then, in the server terminal, run the command:

./run_server –test

this will initialize the server with the testing users and their subsequent balances.
From another terminal window, run the command:

./run_client

this will initialize a new client interface (similar to when you swipe youre debit card at an ATM).  
This will give you a series of options to perform the subsequent tasks associated: 

------MENU------
1:	Get Balance
2:	Send Coin
3:	Quit

After each individual “transaction” the client will log off, so in order to perform multiple transactions 
the user will need to log back, similar to at ATMs (what we modeled it after).  This system is purposefully succint
and simple in terms of it's use, and much of the work is done "undercover" so that the lay man is not able to 
steal and or create money out of thin air (providing they are not testing, and providing a dedicated server is created
in the near future).

Thanks, happy coining and go Irish!
